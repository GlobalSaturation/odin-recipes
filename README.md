# odin-recipes
This is my first project that I have worked on from The Odin Project's Foundations Course.

By creating a website of some of my favorite foods/recipes, I've been able to learn the very basics of starting a website, practice the HTML fundamentals, and (most importantly) practice the basics of Git and writing commit messages.
