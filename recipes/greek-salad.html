  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 large English cucumbers</li>
    <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes</li>
    <li>1/4 red onion</li>
    <li>1/2 bell pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 (4 ounce) package feta cheese, diced, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano, or to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Peel off a few strips of cucumber skin using a channel knife, creating a striped pattern. Cut cucumbers in half crosswise. Cut each half into quarters before cutting into 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices. Place into a colander; toss with some kosher salt and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cut cherry tomatoes in half. Rinse cucumbers; drain thoroughly for 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
    <li>While cucumbers are draining, slice onion thinly. Cut bell pepper into strips. Turn knife diagonally and cut strips into diamond-shaped pieces. Slice Kalamata and green olives.</li>
    <li>Combine cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, olives, and 2 tablespoons oregano in a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Sprinkle in vinegar and toss thoroughly. Drizzle in olive oil. Add about 2/3 of the feta cheese and toss again. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
    <li>Give the salad another mix. Taste and season as desired. Scatter remaining feta cheese on top and garnish with remaining oregano.</li>
  </ol>
